## Importing MDX files

Besides importing components from regular Javascript files, you can also directly import other MDX documents.

> Currently, Confluenza does not include the headings from the imported MDX files in the navigation menu.
The _Importing MDX files_ header above will not show up in the navigation menu.
 

<!-- This default export overrides the default layout ensuring -->
<!--  that the ImportingMDXDocuments component isn't wrapped by other elements -->
export default ({ children }) => (
  <React.Fragment>
    {children}
  </React.Fragment>
)
