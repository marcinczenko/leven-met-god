> **DISCLAIMER:** we do not want to violate any rights of the author and the publisher (Nederland's Boekhuis N.V). The book we publish on this website was published in 1962 and we are not aware of any recent editions. To our best knowledge, the last, sixth edition of this book was published on 1962. The author has passed away in 1992, which means that the authors rights still hold till 2063 unless the book has been made open by the author and the publisher (which, unfortunately we are not aware of). We would love to get in touch with the publisher, but we simply could not find any contact information (Nederland's Boekhuis does not even appear in KvK).
> 
> The reason we decided to publish the book here in the digital form is to make it available to those who cannot buy it anymore and to make it more convenient to use. Even though we currently keep the book accessible to anyone, the number of readers is currently probably less than 10 and we do not expect this number to grow much. We also expect that each reader of the book here would have no problem with buying the book if possible.
>
> Please let us know if anything of this is not accurate or not true. We are prepared to make the website private (and introduce a controlled access so that we can keep it under private use) in case we receive any objection of those who may still hold commercial rights to the book and if they would consider our activity as inappropriate. Any help and mediation in that matter would be appreciated. For any questions or suggestions please write to [info@leven-met-god.xyz](mailto:info@leven-met-god.xyz).
