import { WithBorder, ImportingMDXDocuments } from '../../components/mdx'

[MDX](https://mdxjs.com) allows you to use JSX directly in your Markdown documents.

Imagine, you are documenting a component. Wouldn't it be nice to actually show a working component
directly in your Markdown document? I mean, not a screenshot, or code snippet, but real rendered
component. MDX makes it possible.

Below you see a component that renders its content with a border of the given thickness.

<WithBorder thickness={5}>
  This text should appear in a border `5px` thick.
</WithBorder>

This component is imported as any other regular react component with:

```javascript
import { WithBorder, ImportingMDXDocuments } from '../../components/mdx'
```

> The import statement must be placed directly after _frontmatter_ if one is used.

<ImportingMDXDocuments />

> In this file, as an example, we show that you can import React components and other MDX documents
from any location in your source three. In some cases though, it may be better to keep your _documentation_
components in the same workspace.
